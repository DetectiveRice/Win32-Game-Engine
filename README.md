# Win32-Game-Engine
This was made following Sam's Teach Yourself Game Programming in 24 Hours

Everything is written in C++

A single game engine was made and added to over the course of the book.

Each game that was made are in their separate folders with everything that they required to run. They were all developed in Visual Studio.

The final game was Space Out and it ties together all of the lessons taught in the book.
